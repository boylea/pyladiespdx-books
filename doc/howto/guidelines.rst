Guidelines for Contributing
===========================

Please review all of this page before starting work on a patch

Coding Style
------------
To keep things simple, we will be using the style outlined by the `PEP8 Style Guide for Python Code <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_

Documentation
-------------
Keeping the documentation current, complete and correct is of utmost importance. If you change or add a feature, it must be documented. 
Of course, your contribution may be documentation itself! Yea! We love this. If you are contributing code, a patch submission will not be accepted without proper documentation (but don't worry, we will help you with this if you need it!). For example, this could be simply adding the correctly formatted docstring to your new class or function.

We are using the `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ documentation system, which employs `reStructuredText <http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html#rst-primer>`_ to translate simple text files into inteligent and beautiful HTML files. Again, for simplicity, we are going to use `Python Documentation guidelines <http://docs.python.org/devguide/documenting.html>`_, for the style of the documentation. 

Once we actually get some code and document it, we will detail the organization of it here.

If you have any questions about how or where to add documentation, please contact `Amy <my@email.com>`_


Testing
-------
If you add a feature, it must include a test.


Code Review
-----------
Perform a code review on your code, we can help you with this at meetings.
