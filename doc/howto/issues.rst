===================
Selecting an Issue
===================

We are using the issues feature on GitHub to keep track of bugs and features that still need to be implemented. From the `issues page <https://github.com/jarrighi/pyladiespdx-books/issues>`_ , have a look, and select and open issue that does not yet have anyone assigned. How to claim?
