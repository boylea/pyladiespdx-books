Getting the Source Code
=======================

Attaining Requirements
----------------------

First is it necessary to make sure you have all the required dependencies.

The code for the project is hosted on Github. If you don't have git installed, and/or If you don't already have an account you will need to create one. Follow the instructions for downloading and installing git from `Github <https://github.com/>`_.

Also, if you are new to git, you should familiarize yourself with it. See a tutorial here.

Forking the Repo
----------------
On the `GitHub page <https://github.com/jarrighi/pyladiespdx-books>`_ for the project, fork the repo to your account by clicking the fork button at the top right of the page. This will create a personal copy of the project for you on your account.

Now, to get the code onto your local machine, open a terminal. Copy the repo url from your own fork. It should be of the form `https://github.com/your_username/pyladiespdx-books.git`. ``cd`` to wherever you want to download the code to. Now run:

``git clone https://github.com/your_username/pyladiespdx-books.git``

This should download the source code into a folder named pyladiespdx-books. Give it a wee test run by building and running:

``Look up this command``
