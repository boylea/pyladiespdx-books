pyladiespdx-books
=================

This is app to coordinate access to various books that have been donated to the PDX Pyladies. Because we don't have a central location, we'll keep a list here of the books we have, who currently has them, and how to get in touch with them.

Perhaps in the future we can also add in book request process or host some electronic resources as well.

This is a work in progress. For instructions on how to contribute see ProjectCoordination.md

###Agreement:

By participating in the distributed library, a PyLady aggrees to some things, but I don't know what these are yet. 

Perhaps:

* will pass the book to someone else if she will be unavailable for more than a week (or some other time period)
* will respond to a request within a week

###How to use this:

To start with this will just be a list of the books we have, who has them and how to get in touch with them.
