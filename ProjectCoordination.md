###Project description:
---
The PDX Pyladies group has been accumulating donated books.
We need a simple web app to keep track of our distributed PDX Pyladies library. It would be hard to coordinate a central location to keep all of these books, so we can instead keep track of which Pylady has each book. Eventually we'd also like to be able to email pyladies through the app and allow each person to confirm the handoff

To start off this will be a django app hosted on heroku
